# Planning Public Policy in Argentina
In this R notebook, I use PCA and k-means to analyze indicators and demonstrate a prescriptive analysis.

The data file is attached here and includes ten indicators on the different provinces in Argentina.

I use PCA to reduce redundancies in the data, and to coalesce highly correlated indicators. I then use k-means to cluster the provinces depending on these new correlators. We see some interesting visualiations throughout the process, and read a variable correlation plot.
